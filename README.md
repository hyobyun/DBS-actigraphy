# DBS-actigraphy
R code used to study patient activity with a GPS and a pedometer. Don't expect to be able to just press run on this script. I am leaving it on here just incase the code may be helpful for someone.

Some features
---
* Parse data from Omron Pedometers
* Parse data from QStarz GPS
* Parse data from Magellan GPS
* Calculate meters traveled per day
* Calculate average veloctiy per day
* Normalize data with missing days
